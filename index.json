These results suggest the attentional impairments observed in depression are not associated with depression state or history as previously hypothesized and assumed, but rather familial risk for depression. We then examined how aberrant executive functioning may lead to depression via intermediate processes like attentional biases and rumination, providing the first empirical evidence connecting executive functioning to depression via these depressogenic phenotypes. We also examined the differential relationship of these executive processes with depression and anxiety. Unlike studies in non-clinical samples, our findings suggest that impaired attentional focusing, but not attentional shifting, appears to play a significant role in depression and anxiety maintenance.\nRelevant work  Hsu, K.J., Forgeard, M.J.C., Stein, A., Beard, C., \u0026amp; Björgvinsson, T.

Our prior work indicates that attention bias for negative information is associated with the maintenance of depression and that neural circuitry within frontal-parietal brain networks supports biased attention for negative information, thus allowing us to develop specific and targeted interventions that directly alter the neurobiology of negative attention bias. The proposed R33 study builds upon our prior NIMH funded work (R21MH092430), which examined whether ABM reduces negative attention bias and improves symptoms of depression. Findings indicate that compared to placebo ABM, active ABM reduced negative attention bias and increased resting state connectivity within a neural circuit (i.e., middle frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) that supports control over emotional information. Further, change in negative attention bias from pre- to post-ABM was significantly correlated with depression symptom change but only in the active training condition. Importantly, a 40% decrease in symptoms was observed in the active training condition; however, similar symptom reduction was also observed in the “placebo ABM” condition. Exploratory analyses indicated that placebo training may have promoted depression improvement by enhancing sustained attention. Although these preliminary findings are encouraging and demonstrate that ABM successfully alters the treatment target (i.e., negative attention bias), our prior work is among the first to document efficacy of ABM among adults with clinically significant depression. We believe it is prudent and necessary to obtain additional efficacy evidence for ABM before moving forward with large-scale clinical trials of ABM for depression. Aim 1 is to conduct a randomized clinical trial among adults with elevated symptoms of depression and a negative attention bias that compares the efficacy of active ABM to placebo ABM and an assessment-only control condition that does not involve any ABM procedures. Aim 2 is to examine whether ABM alters negative attention bias and functional connectivity within frontal-parietal neural circuitry that support negative attention bias. Aim 3 is to identify mechanisms responsible for the putative efficacy of active and placebo ABM. Study Impact: The current project proposes to target and reduce negative attention bias with a novel intervention grounded in basic psychopathology research. We believe this experimental medicine approach will lead to the development of a highly specific and targeted intervention, using cutting- edge cognitive neuroscience to inform treatment development, and improve the quality of life of people whose psychopathology is maintained by negative attention bias.\n","date":1555477200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555477200,"objectID":"5dc59e709b06d1851fe71c2c1fd25703","permalink":"/project/r33/","publishdate":"2019-04-17T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/r33/","section":"project","summary":"Attention Bias Modification Treatment RCT.","tags":["R33","Internal","UT-Austin","Basic cognitive processes"],"title":"COmputerized Modification Program for Attention - REtraining the Mind Trial (COMPARE Mind Trial)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Repetitive negative thinking (e.g., rumination; RNT) is a transdiagnostic process of increasing interest in theoretical models of psychopathology and in empirical study.

Cognitive models of depression, which have received strong empirical support, posit that individuals\u0026rsquo; characteristic ways of attending to, interpreting, and remembering stimuli in their environment may contribute to the development and maintenance of the disorder. To understand the etiology of these biases, many genetic association studies have been completed. However, findings so far (including those from our own work) have been somewhat limited. Although genetic association studies have value, we strongly believe that whole genome methods will provide new insights into the role of genetic variation in psychopathology. Aim 1 is to comprehensively measure phenotypes related to negative cognitive bias in a community sample of 1500 adults of European ancestry. We propose to use established behavioral, eye tracking, and electrophysiological tasks to comprehensively measure negatively biased attention, interpretation, and memory—central features of contemporary cognitive models of depression. Aim 2 is to quantify the aggregate contribution of genetic variation across the genome to cognitive vulnerability. We propose to use genomic-relatedness-matrix restricted maximum likelihood to estimate the aggregate genetic effect of approximately 900,000 polymorphisms that measure exomic and common genetic variation across the entire genome. This will provide an answer to the fundamental question of how much variance in these key phenotypes is due to variation in measured polymorphisms. Aim 3 is to develop biologically plausible cumulative genetic scores (CGS) to identify linkages between specific genetic variation and our phenotypes. We have created gene sets derived from a database of known and predicted protein interactions and from human brain atlases with genetic and anatomic information. Importantly, our large sample allows us to perform a confirmatory study for these gene sets. Upon study conclusion, we will make our data publically available so investigators can develop additional gene sets that putatively relate to cognitive vulnerability. In sum, the proposed study will provide much needed insight into the degree to which these theoretically motivated intermediate phenotypes for depression are associated with genetic variation. Although twin studies point to the possibility of a genetic etiology, no attempts have been made to quantify the contribution of measured genetic variation to these cognitive phenotypes. This will provide much needed guidance about how much variance in cognitive vulnerability to depression can be predicted with genome- wide based analyses and may help account for some of the missing heritability often associated with candidate polymorphism studies.\n","date":1555218000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555218000,"objectID":"7c8d34383a617f0833a7e7a320148999","permalink":"/project/r56/","publishdate":"2019-04-14T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/r56/","section":"project","summary":"Further details coming soon. \nProject Abstract (from NIH RePORTER): Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide among adults.
