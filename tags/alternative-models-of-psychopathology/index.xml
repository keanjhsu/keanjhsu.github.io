      <description>Traditional approaches to psychopathology (e.g., the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) often fail at adequately characterizing clinical disorder, as suggested by high comorbidity rates and significant heterogeneity within diagnostic categories. Therefore, alternative approaches to understanding psychopathology are needed to better carve nature at its joints. We have employed two data-intensive approaches to characterize psychopathology in a sample with significant heterogeneity and comorbidity.
